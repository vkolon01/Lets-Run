Social Network designed for runners. 

Users will be able to socialize with other runners by creating running events, groups or share routes ideas.

[MVC design pattern](http://www.bogotobogo.com/DesignPatterns/mvc_model_view_controller_pattern.php) is used for the project with decoupled server and client.
