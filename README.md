# Lets-Run
Social Network designed for runners. 

Users will be able to socialize with other runners by creating running events, groups or share routes ideas.

[MVC architectural pattern](http://www.bogotobogo.com/DesignPatterns/mvc_model_view_controller_pattern.php) is used for the project with decoupled server and client.

The server-side is built using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**.
The client-side is built with **React.js** using [FLUX architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview.html#content).
